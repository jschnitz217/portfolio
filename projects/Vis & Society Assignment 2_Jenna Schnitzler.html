					<br> <em> Chart depicting frequency of buildings converted to condominiums by original construction date </em><br>
					My entry point into this data set was through plotting the original construction date (sorted into bins by decade) of each converted building in Boston as a histogram. This gives us a sense of the overall age of the building stock that this dataset contains. This chart then shows the number of buildings in our dataset constructed every decade; showing a construction boom in the late 1800s-early 1900s, and again in the 2000s.

				Next, I created another univariate histogram that represents the frequency of buildings converted by conversion year (Calculated as FIELD:Year post -1) - and noticed a hole in the dataset; within the 2015-2024 range, according to the dataset, no buildings were converted in 2017. This reason for this gap is unknown, according to the Boston Property Assessment website (https://data.boston.gov/dataset/property-assessment), data was collected annually from 2004 to 2024, so 2017 should be represented as it appears on their database. Further investigation into this data gap with the teaching team would be worthwhile to determine if it represents a real gap or a gap by means of some data joining error.

					For easier reading, I grouped year converted into three categories - early (2015-2017), middle (2018-2020), and late (2021-2023). The distribution of conversion dates generally follows the pattern of the original construction dates, indicating that original construction date has little impact on when a building gets converted. Structures built after 2020 therefore are an exception, which indicates that this might not be the best way to get at this question, as they would have no other option but to be converted as part of the "late" group.

				For my second attempt at finding out if building age has an effect on conversion year, I instead plotted each building in the dataset in terms of years between remodel and conversion, sorted by year converted (note 2017 is missing). Years since renovation then, rather than original construction date, seems to be a better piece of information; there is a definite trend showing that the majority of buildings are converted within 20 years of renovation, regardless of original construction date.

					<br> <em> Plotting overall condition before conversion against years since renovation, as well as frequency of condition status </em> <br>
				I wanted to better understand if there was a relationship between how recently a building was renovated and its overall condition before conversion. From this chart, we can deduce that buildings in excellent condition were generally renovated most recently (within the last 5 years), and years since renovation seems to decrease as overall condition ratings improve. In order to understand how data quality was affecting this relationship, I plotted rating frequency, to find that most buildings in the dataset were rated either average or good, and have been renovated within the last 25 years. I noticed that there were a lot of buildings in the data set that did not have this field filled out (only 621 entries of the 2245 entries have values in the overall prior condition field, or just over 25%).

					<br> <em> Frequency of conversion by structure type classification </em> <br>
				Beyond the date of original construction, time since renovation, and overall building condition prior to conversion, another factor that might contribute to likelihood of conversion is the type of structure. Originally when I plotted this data, there were many redundant categories that motivated me to go into the set's metadeta to better understand and define these classifications, and I was able to group redundant structure class types.

					Most converted structures are of structure class R-Residential, but some other structural classes are represented in the data set. I mapped year built as an additional dimension (color) to try and see if there were any trends with what types of structures were built when, but it is hard in the format shown in Figure 6. By switching the axes to show the year built, and rather color coding by structure class, we can see some larger, overall trends; that structural steel was not represented until the 1960s, and reinforced concrete use began tapering off after the 1930s.

					The geographic data included in the set includes zip codes and city data - here I mapped number of conversions by zip code with the maximum and minimum annotated on the map (210 buildings converted in ???, just one in ?, ?, and ?). Using color to indicate number of conversions by zip code, we can see that the perimeter counties seem to be more actively converting their buildings to condos in comparison to downtown Boston. When we start to look at the data by city however, I first changed the zip-code boundary to a single dot whose size represented the number of buildings converted in the area code (the same information in the map on the left). Looking at this representation made me question if all the zip codes for each city were grouped together, would the data tell a different story about conversion frequency.

					These bubble diagrams show the total number of buildings converted in each city - Boston proper, which seemed to have a low number of conversions according to the previous visualizations, is actually closer to the middle of all the cities represented in terms of conversion frequency. When we change the size of the bubble to represent the total number of condo units rather than single buildings, then we see Boston actually has the largest number of units of all the cities in the dataset, vastly different than you might think looking at the previous maps.

					This is because generally (by average number of condo units per converted building), the converted buildings in Boston are larger than the other cities included in the dataset, and zipcodes on the perimeter.

					I was also curious about the land use types of the addresses undergoing conversion, and mapped the frequency of each Land Use (LU) type prior to conversion alphabetically in the top graph, and reordered in terms of total counts in the middle graph. Before conversion, more addressed were of the CD (residential condominium unit) or R3, R2, and R1 (3, 2, and single family residential) land use types. After conversion, the amount of addresses zoned as R2 and R3 drastically decreased, and most were converted to the CM (Condominium main (physical structure housing all related condo units with no assessed value)) type.

					Mapping the change in land use type geographically shows that this trend occurs pretty universally across all the zip codes - the majority of the addressed become zoned as CM post conversion, regardless of location. This could indicate the impact of some sort of larger policy/conversion protocol.

					The potential profit of conversion is anecdotally referenced in the article about the Millbrook Lofts in Somerville, so I was curious about the scale of profit attained through the condo conversion process. Profit in this case is approximated as building value after conversion - building value pre-conversion, in lieu of any sales data. In general, according to this dataset, conversion seems to be a profitable endeavor for building owners, evidenced by the fact that the trend line in the graph above has a far steeper slope than the breakeven point, marked by the dashed line. I question the validity of the outliers in terms of buildings losing value in the conversion process (-43M and -63M in particular) and would want to investigate these data points further.

				Yet, overall building condition seems unaffected by conversion - all the entries that had values for these fields show no change between overall building condition before and after conversion. Far fewer entries had valuable interior condition metrics, but of the 325 that were assessed for this metric, there was no change noted between interior condition before and after conversion. From this, it seems possible to make the conclusion that conversion has no impact on interior conditions.

				Just as building condition seems relatively unaffected by conversion, so does the amount of total living area. It appears that most data points fall on the dashed line indicating no change between total pre-conversion square footage and total square footage after conversion. Even so, the trend line produced in Tableau indicates a slight trend towards reduction to total living area. If we zoom into where most of the data is concentrated, we can actually find a crossover point- buildings with under 15,000 square feet of living space tend to gain living space upon conversion, and buildings above this threshold lose living space overall.
